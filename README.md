# IPL Auction Data Analysis

## Overview

This data analysis project explores the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction data for the years 2022 and 2023. The project aims to gain insights into player costs, team strategies, and trends during these two IPL seasons. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Structure

- `IPL_2023-22_Sold_Players.csv`: The dataset containing IPL auction data.
- `ipl_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: This README file providing project information.
  
## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Usage
To run the data analysis and visualization code, follow these steps:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open `ipl_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or a compatible Python IDE.
- Run the code cells to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.
- Modify the code as needed for further analysis or customization.


## Data Cleaning

Before analysis, the dataset underwent cleaning, including removing extra whitespace, converting data types, and handling missing values.

## Data Exploration and Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to understand the data:
1. Total cost spent on different player types (e.g., all-rounders, bowlers) in 2022 and 2023.
2. Nationality-wise player prices and shifts in dynamics.
3. Team-wise player recruitment strategies.
4. Team-wise total costs.
5. Distribution of Indian and Overseas players.
6. Identification of the top 5 most expensive players in each season and player type.

## Conclusions

Key findings from the analysis include:
- All-rounders were the most expensive player type.
- 2022 was more expensive than 2023 in terms of player acquisitions.
- A preference for Indian players over overseas players was observed.
